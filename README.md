## ‚öôÔ∏è Local Installation Guide

Follow these steps to get a copy of this project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Python 3.8+**: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
*   **pip**: Python package installer (usually comes with Python)
*   **Git**: Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads/)

### Step-by-Step Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    Open your terminal (Git Bash recommended for Windows) and clone the project to your desired directory:

    ```bash
    git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>
    cd portfolio
    ```

    *(Replace `<YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.)*

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment**

    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies. Navigate to the root of your project (where `manage.py` is located) and create one:

    ```bash
    python -m venv myenv
    ```

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment**

    *   **Windows (Command Prompt/PowerShell):**
        ```bash
        .\myenv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   **Windows (Git Bash):**
        ```bash
        source myenv/Scripts/activate
        ```
    *   **macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source myenv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install Dependencies**

    With your virtual environment activated, install all required packages using `pip`:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Apply Migrations**

    Django uses migrations to define your database schema. Apply the initial migrations:

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

6.  **Create a Superuser (for Admin Panel access)**

    You'll need a superuser account to access the Django admin panel:

    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
    Follow the prompts to create your username, email, and password.

7.  **Collect Static Files**

    This command gathers all static files (CSS, JavaScript, images) into a single directory, which is important for deployment and often for development as well:

    ```bash
    python manage.py collectstatic
    ```
    Type `yes` when prompted.

8.  **Run the Development Server**

    Finally, start the Django development server:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

    You can now access the project in your web browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
    To access the admin panel, go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` and log in with the superuser credentials you created.

## ‚úÖ Testing the Project

To ensure everything is working correctly, you can run Django's built-in tests:

```bash
python manage.py test
